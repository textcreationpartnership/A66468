            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I know of no Syſtems, of Divinity nor Philoſophy, expoſed to Humane View, but there may be Objections raiſed, that cannot (by the beſt Wits) be eaſily, if at all, Anſwered. It will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be expected from him that is ſo Captious and envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Critical, to ſet forth ſomething in which will be no Contradiction nor Diſconſonancy; and then he may more reaſonably find fault: But as it is improbable, nay utterly impoſſible to pleaſe all, ſo the Author expects not to be diſliked by all; and if what he hath here publiſh'd pleaſe but the beſt, or be profitable to any, he hath his end, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires nothing more than the Manifeſtation of the Truths of God in Nature and Scripture; whoſe aim and end is to be his Servant, and every Mans Brother,</p>

And <hi>there was</hi> a kind of <hi>War: Michael and his Angels expelled Lucifer and his</hi> Dragon-<hi>Angels out of Heaven:</hi> And yet it was no real War, for Heaven ſpewed him out of its own accord, <hi>and he was caſt out,</hi> as Dung, <hi>into the</hi> curſed part of <hi>the Earth; and his Souldiers,</hi> his Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, <hi>were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus alſo <hi>Lucifer</hi> for Madneſs ſought to ſlay his own innate proper Virgin, after he had failed in deflowering of her, which was contrary to the Law of Eternity: And therefore he opened the Matrice of the wrathful Nature, and was united with, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated a Dragon-like Eſſence, &amp; to his own everlaſting Torment, ſo that now he burns in the Hellish Fire of his Conſumption, never to be conſumed: And <hi>hath great Wrath</hi> and Envy <hi>againſt</hi> the Son of <hi>Man,</hi> who is to dethrone him, <hi>becauſe he knows he has but a ſhort time.

The Soul is like a Child that cannot ſpeak, even as <hi>a Lamb dumb before the</hi> Butcher, <hi>his Voice is not heard in the Street</hi> of Mans City; <hi>He is afflicted and grieved, and yet opens not his Mouth:</hi> I ſay, The Soul's Spirit is like a poor afflicted ſickly Child, that can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but jabber a little: The poor Child repines, murmurs, whines and grumbles; and is ſtill diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: Give him what you will, yet ſtill he hath the ſame tone: Then the Mother or Nurſe asks, What doſt thou lack, my dear Child? O that I knew thy want! Come, my ſweet Child, my poor ſick Child, we will make thee a well-reliſh'd Diſh: No, no, ſaith the Child, in effect, making Signs by the Averſion of his head. Wilt thou have this ſine Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to play with?

                  <p>Am I ſo hard to pleaſe (ſaith the Child, if he could ſpeak) Yes, ſaith the Nnrſe, thou knoweſt not thy own Mind. Do I not, ſaith the Child, in his Mind: I want none of thoſe fine things you would put me off with: I want no Lullaby, I want Eaſe and Quietneſs: I would faſt ſome ſmall time from thoſe falſe Delights which was the cauſe of my Malady: I want Eaſe: O eaſe me of this pain, and then I will be quiet, and not before.</p>
                  <p>Therefore hereby All know very well what it is the Soul would have, and what it ſeeks after, that is, Food, Fewel, and Satisfaction for its fiery longing Hunger: Which if it hath, it will be ſatisfied, and not till then. The fire longs for the Light: If it burns in ſecret, it is in pain and in anguiſh. <hi>All things are full of Labour: Man</hi> eſpecially <hi>cannot utter</hi> his own Labour, and travail of his Soul: <hi>The Eye</hi> of the Mind <hi>is not ſatisfied with ſeeing</hi> Vanity: <hi>Nor the Ear</hi> of the Spirit <hi>filled with hearing</hi> Childiſh Rattles: Therefore <hi>Vanity of Vanities, (ſaith the</hi> firſt and laſt <hi>Preacher) Vanities of Vanities, all is Vanity,</hi> whatever it is, tho' ſeemingly pleaſant, which refreſheth not the Spirit of the Soul.</p>

But O Man, if thou findeſt in thy ſelf that thou longeſt for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that thou haſt all things according to thy wiſh, as thou wouldſt have it to be; and that thou art fortunate in every accident that happens to thee, and that nothing croſſeth thy Mind; that thou art content in whatſoever ſtate thou art; that thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver vexeſt nor tormenteſt thy ſelf in Proſperity or Adverſity; and that thy Soul takes all Accidents for Good, having framed it ſelf to receive all things in good part, then it hath attained its deſire, and the Longing ceaſeth.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt ſay, My Soul is not in that Frame: My Soul within me is always wanting and craving, and very hard to pleaſe: It knows not what it would have: It wills, and it wills not. Am I ſo humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome? ſaith the Soul: Well might I deſerve the blame, if I were like one mad or frantick, (as if one longed for the Kings Crown, to which one can claim no Title, ſeeming to be poſſeſſed with a ſtrange fury) or if I were like a Childing Woman, longing for things unprocurable for money: Even as a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Deceiver, being pregnant of a falſe Eſſence, longeth for ſtrange Properties, which endangers the Soul: But I deſire that which deſires me, and cries, O my dear Companion, come and receive me: for I ſtand here very loneſome in a ſolitary condition, except ſome Soul pity me, and entertain me: If I longed for far-fetched Treaſures, and dear-bought bought Sawces and Jewels procured by the Blood of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35910:15"/>others, which all hazard the Eternal Life, there would be ſome colour for blaming me: But that which I long for, is eaſily procured, and (if not too much ſlighted and neglected at firſt) obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wracking Labour and Care.</p>
                  <p>Now perhaps you will mock me, and impute this my Longing to a fooliſh Fancy; and ſay to me in ſcorn: Ah ha! But I defie your Reproaches: Give me my Deſire, or I will vex and worry you for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more: Now I am come as a Sojurner to view this outward World: But I will not partake of your falſe Joys, and count them a ſatisfaction of my mind: For <hi>all is a Vexation of</hi> my <hi>Spirit.</hi> If you will not give me Food for my Hunger, (mark well) I will be glutted like an Horſe-Leech with the Blood of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Souls, to Eternity; and then I will vomit up all again, as previous to a freſh thirſt after Blood.</p>
                  <p>I was born crying when I came firſt into this World, and that makes it manifeſt that I longed to go back again to lean upon my Virgin-Mothers ſweet Breſts: I cried, <hi>Give, give;</hi> O give me ſome of my Virgin-Milk.</p>
                  <p>Here may ſeem an Objection to lie in the wny: Whimſie of Whimſies, (ſaith the vain Atheiſt) <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Vanities, All is</hi> a Whim, whatever checketh the Soul, and is <hi>a Vexation to</hi> his luſtful <hi>Spirit.</hi> What is the Voice in the Conſcience which oppoſeth the Hamane Luſt, but a <hi>Vain</hi> Whimſie, which the Beaſts are not ſenſible of?

                  <p>But the Atheiſt affirms, <hi>Cum prorepſerunt primis Animalia terris,</hi> &amp;c. There was a time when Humane Animals, as a mute and filthy Cattle, crept upon the Earth, and wandred like Beaſts, the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger driving the weaker out of his Cave: Fighting with their Claws and Fiſts, until afterwards Uſe and Art invented the framing of Weapons.</p>
                  <p>After wandring they came into Society: And then invented Articulate Sounds, to diſcover the meaning of their Minds to one another; and ſo Reaſon taught them to abſtain from ſighting about their Food, and from ſnatching, as Bulls or Dogs, an uncertain Concubine one from the other.</p>
                  <p>Then they invented the Marking out their Minds by Images upon Tables, and made Law to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35910:16"/>every Mans Propriety from another. But thoſe Laws being not able to Bridle them, they at laſt invented, there was a Juſt Eye in ſecret that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved every Unjuſt Action: That ſo they might be afraid to ſteal, or commit Fornication.</p>

Let ſuch an Atheiſt read Hiſtory: For he ſhall find there is no Hiſtory that ſhews the Manners of any People, but it ſhews alſo, or gives a hint of their Religion. The Voice of every Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal likewiſe, calling to the Lord of Nature, when any ſudden fear ſeizeth upon them, proves a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Power.</p>
                  <p>There was one told his Friend, That when he was young he thought there was no Hell in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; but now being old, he began to doubt, what if there be one?</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing the Atheiſt pleads, That as the Flame of an Extinguiſhed Candle diſſolves and loſeth it ſelf in the Circumambient Air, even ſo the Taper of Life vaniſheth into pure <hi>AEther,</hi> and is no more, when the Law of Union of Body and Soul is viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and broken. <hi>Second Spira.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But let him know that right Honour is an Advancement of Love: For in Heaven there is not the leaſt defire of Revenge: As may be ſeen in the Son of God himſelf, than whom none is more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, yet He is that which helpeth and ſaveth Nature, which is gone out of its Order, and becomes a Servant of Servants, ſtooping to Death for the ſake of Mankind. The Babe is greateſt in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But Honour that rigorouſly ruleth by Force is no Honour: He is not long feared, that is not always loved. It is true, God alone by his Power muſt keep up the Wall and Fence of the Gulf between
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35910:17"/>the two Natures, to keep them in Harmony, which Harmony he himſelf is in the Abſtract: Or elſe the Fire of Hell would break in, and deſtroy the being of the firſt Eſſence in the Love-World, which was without beginning.</p>
                  <p>But the Atheiſt yet imagines that becauſe he dreams of frightful things, and the Idea's that he hath of them impreſs afflicting Reſentments upon his Spirits, as if they were real; but when he awakes he ſaith all vaniſhes. <hi>Second Spira.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We will ſuppoſe a Man in a terrible Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick Dream, and that the ſaid man ſhould Eternally remain in that Condition, wherein the Soul is as really diſturbed, frighted, and put out of Harmony, as if he had been awake.</p>
                  <p>That is, The Fright that he is aſſaulted with, is real to the Imagination of the Soul, as may be perceived that it many times trembles, and continues in a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling poſture after waking a long time. Now you will ſay all vaniſhes, and paſſeth into Silence, when the Soul recovers it ſelf by the outward Senſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But ſuppoſe it had no ſuch recourſe, as to ſeiz upon the Body and wake it when it is ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly affrighted, to rid it ſelf out of the ſuppoſed imminent Danger.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe it were then in the Sleep of Death, and the Body will not be waked; where ſhall the Body ſeek ſhelter then? The temporal Sleep being a true figure of Death, even the firſt Death, or ſleep of the Body in the Grave.</p>
                  <p>And as the Soul is ſenſible of a real Joy or Sorrow in Dreams and Viſions: So alſo in Death why may not it feel the ſame? Seeing the Soul by its creative Imagination frames either an Heaven or Hell to it ſelf, and is really ſenſible thereof, without the uſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35910:18"/>of the material Organs, while the Body is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Senſe in ſleep; or, which is all one, dead to the Natural Functions of the External <hi>Senſoriums.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that it is very clear and plain againſt all Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical Deniers of the Souls Immortality, even an Eternal Teſtimony for Gods being, and the Souls everlaſting abode either in Life, or in feeling Deaths Property, called Pain or Hell; that there is no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial thing that can hurt or afflict the Soul, either in Sleep or Death, but only its own Imagination or <hi>Turba,</hi> which the Worm of the Soul cauſeth.</p>
                  <p>Thus in Dreams, the Paſſion wherewith the Soul is affected, ſeems a Shadow of a Fancy after wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: So the matter of this outward World ſeems (and is indeed nothing more than) a Shadow, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the two Real, Subſtantial, Eternal Worlds.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the Creation of the World, <hi>there was no new thing</hi> done, but what was done in the Eternal Myſtery before, in the Nonage of Time: And all Created Beings will eternally abide in the Figure and Shadow: Yet in the Stilneſs: For when we ſay Beaſts have no immortal <hi>Souls,</hi> it muſt be meant they enter back again, or <hi>downwards,</hi> into the Root of their Firſt Conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>That is, Though they are now out of their firſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35910:18"/>Order, yet the Breach thereof ſhall not be imputed to them, becauſe it was not their Fault but Mans, and they ſprung forth <hi>each according to his kind,</hi> or Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Property in the Seed of their Souls of Life, ſo they ſhall be manifeſt Eternally in the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But the Atheiſt objecteth ſtill, That the Conceit of the Soul is very deceitful, and as unconſtant as <hi>Proteus.</hi> For if the Mind ſtrongly conceits a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to it ſelf, the Myſtery of the ſame conceit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, makes an intenſion of its Heaven: We of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſee that Love after Marriage grows Languid: Whereas the ſame Love before the Enjoyment of its wiſhed Object, was ſo elevated and wrapt up in the ſaid Object, that it counted the ſame a ſeeming Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But many times two Lovers (who have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the Bloſſom of the Tincture of <hi>Venus.</hi>) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect one another by their burning Luſt, ſo that they become Deadly Enemies, even theſe very ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who were ready to impart the Heart within them one to the other, if it could be done without Dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And tho' ſometimes the Complexion of others are more Noble, and ſtill ſome Love remains, yet it is not always ſo pure and faithful as the firſt.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Ask thy own Mind, why will not it give over Imagination, and lie in Silence? Ask a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man why he will not ſtop the Wheel of his Mind, that rolleth about too violently? Ask a Man why he will not in ſleep dream of Comedies? And enquire whether any of theſe <hi>have power over this Spirit of</hi> Phantacy, <hi>to retain the Spirit</hi> by his own Power.</p>
                  <p>It is true both in the Light and in the Wrath-World, which ſoever of the Seven Properties are predominant in the ſeven fold Wheel of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mind, that will by and by be lowermoſt: But in the Love Kingdom one Property deſireth not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the reſt out of the Harmony, or to move and turn the Wheels backward.</p>
                  <p>This is demonſtrated in all things, eſpecially in Muſick: For tho' there be inſinite Varieties of Notes and Tunes, according to the Altering and Tranſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the ſeven Sounds, yet (tho' the Saturnine or Martial String may be predominant) while an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is dexterouſly handled, the reſt by a ſecret ſympathy will bind them in a Melodious Harmony.</p>
                  <p>And this is alſo obſervable, That the end of a Tune hath ſome Reſemblance to the beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereof; to ſhew that when the Harmony of the Sphears or Stars of Time ſhall find its beginning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, then will it be ſwallowed up in an Eternal Conſort of the Properties: Excepting thoſe Eſſences
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35910:19"/>who have ſpoiled their Materials, or rather changed the form of their Breaſts, according to the Pattern of which the Inſtrument is to be tuned.</p>
                  <p>It may alſo be ſeen in the Variety of other Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibles: For in taſte there are many thouſand Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet if the ſeven Properties be rightly and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially mixed, tho' the Saturnine property be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, yet the other Properties will bind it in an equal Accord: The like is underſtood of other qualities, too tedions to enumerate.</p>
                  <p>Thus by what hath been ſaid, it is clear that <hi>a</hi> terrible <hi>Dream comes from the multitude of</hi> vain <hi>Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and a Fool in his Eternal Melancholly Fit of Angnith, ſnores in a deep ſleep of Deſpair, and ſees horrid Spectiums that impoſeth real Puniſhment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Soul, according to his Lot and Degree.</p>
                  <p>And to anſwer the aforeſaid Objection, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt that when a Man is in love with a Maid: (the Object engaged to his Nobleſt Paſſion, her Idea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were ſtamped upon his Spirit with the Character of Sympathy) Tho' you proſer him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maid far more worthy in Beauty and Nobility than the former, yet none will content his Fancy, or ſtop the current of his Paſſion, but the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her, (to whoſe Service he was made Votary before) or Death.</p>
                  <p>Even ſo the Soul being in love, and enamoured with his fair Virgin, though you proffer him all the External Joys and Pleaſures that the World can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, yet the Soul doth ſlight all, and contemn them in compariſon of the Virgins Love.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Tho' this External Love hath ſome Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy (if it be pure and Faithful) to the love between the Soul and Gods pure Virgin; yet there is a difference between the Phantacy and Imagination, in

                  <p>Though I ſaid before that there was an unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Law, or Rule of Eternity, by which all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creatures, Angels and Men muſt be governed, yet it is not meant, that this Law was any other than a Law of natural Love: It was no Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contrary to the Inclination of the ſaid Eternal Eſſences: (For to ſpeak properly, a Law is given to ſhew Tranſgreſſion:) But it was a Law of Love and Sympathy, which they by natural Inſtinct ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as naturally as every Creature loves Life and ſhuns Death: It was the ſtraight Rule of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life and Joy. From which if any Eternal Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſwerve and change his Form and become <hi>Crooked, it cannot be ever made ſtraight</hi> again: <hi>And that which is wanting</hi> to the compoſing of an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <hi>cannot be numbred</hi> in the Election of God: It was the Law of pure <hi>Philautia:</hi> Love thy ſelf and God: whoſe Image thou thy ſelf art: Indulge thy Fortunate Genius, defraud him not: This Law was not indifferent but neceſſary, and therefore may well be termed an Eternal Law.</p>

                  <p>NOW then, O Man, I will ask Thee a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: Doſt thou think thou cameſt to be a Creature into the World, purpoſely to Eat and Drink and to take thy Pleaſure? Thou wilt ſay, No, perhaps: But I ſay Yes: That was the Cauſe thou cameſt into this World, and only ſo thou gloriſieſt thy Creator, who ſent for Thee out of the Abyſs and Womb of Eternity: This was his beginningleſs Law to Angels and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preceding Eſſences, and this ſame Law will ſtand for Man-ſucceeding Creatures in the endleſs Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, if any ſhall ever be Created by the Creator hereafter, when the Humane World ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated: For (as we ſaid before) <hi>All the Labour of Man is for his Mouth,</hi> and his holy digeſting Throat, if he knows how to feed on the Tree of Eternal Life and Pleaſure in eating and drinking and ſporting in the Angelical Paſtime, and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Flowers in Paradiſe: <hi>And yet the Appetite of the Fool</hi> who miſuſed this Pleaſure, and contracted upon himſelf the Diſeaſe of the Greedies <hi>is not fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:</hi> His Canine Appetite or <hi>Orexis</hi> is never ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>Again, another Fool longs after ſtrange Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35910:27"/>Objects, which tend not to the ſatisfaction of the Appetite, and are not proper Food for him: And <hi>gives his Money for that which is not Bread, and his Labour for that which profiteth not</hi> his Soul, and the well-being of himſelf, <hi>What is Man the better</hi> for them? What would this Fool have? He knows not himſelf: He wills this: He refuſes that: He wracks himſelf and his own Spirit: And what is this but much Pains to little purpoſe? And though it be true, that it is a piece of Wiſdom to reſerve the beſt till laſt, And he is not wiſe that ſuffers himſelf to be condemned by the poor ſilly Ant, who knows (by an inſtinct of Nature or Law of Creation) his time, and laies up or provides in the Summer againſt Winter: And he is a Fool that will fare above his Purſe to day and want to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and eats and drinks beyond the Power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and thereby gets a Surfeit or Diſeaſe; yet there is no need for Man to gather up more then needs, <hi>ſeeing there be many things that increaſe Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and Emptineſs, and meer husks not proper Food for the Soul.</p>

Or what would Mortal Man have to give himſelf reſt? For the End of all Motion is Reſt: And the End of all Travail is Refreſhment, the End of Longing is the Enjoyment of a thing Loved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Phantafie ſorceth the Soul out of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Poſture to work againſt the Hair: And as the Ancient Proverb ſaith, Love is Blind, and that which is deformed ſeems fair in the Souls Eye. And becauſe God hath forbidden the Tree of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to be touched, therefore Man hath a ſtrong Fancy that there is ſome great Myſtery in it: And ſo like a Fool he comes to be governed by Fancy, not conſidering there is no Smoak without Fire: which not prevented, his Houſe may be burned.</p>
                  <p>But to clear the Myſtery of this Subject ſtill plainer to the Underſtanding: It is well known, where Fancy is ſtrong, the Author chooſeth a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Life, while he enjoyeth a thing loved or fancied, and feels not the Pain: And prefers it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Life of Pleaſure without the Society of the Object his Love: For he cannot enjoy Pleaſure in Pleaſure, while the one thing fancied is withheld and kept back from him: And the beſt thing being out of ſight is out of Mind.</p>

                  <p>For like a Leech he chooſeth to glut himſelf with the Blood of falſe Pleaſure, and then to ſpue up all again, rather than to enjoy the true reſt of his Mind in Contentment. So <hi>Mans Ruine is of himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Soul ſacrificing the Spirit (as being the true Child in the Regeneration) there are Drums and loud Muſicks ſounding to ſtop his Cries, that

And here alſo ariſeth another Queſtion, how ſhall the Soul attain to ſatisfie his Longing and vehement Deſire? This is the Leſſon which the whole World of Mankind are yet ſeeking to learn, and for the moſt part learned as well as unlearned, are ſtupid and dull in the comprehending of it, becauſe they would learn it the wrong way.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>God hath ſet the World in Mans Heart, ſo that Man cannot find out the Work that God maketh from the beginning to the end</hi> of his Life, without the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Revelation of the Spirit of the ſame God.</p>
                  <p>For firſt Man muſt by the Aſſiſtance of this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Phyſitian cure the Diſtemper of his Soul, and then he will love the thing enjoyned: For what is the moſt pleaſant Dainties in the World to an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared Stomack.</p>

If he would be but willing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt ſhe makes her Addreſs to her Virgin-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and intreats her that ſhe would grant her the favour of going out to ſee the Daughters of the Humane Land, as <hi>rejoycing in the habitable Parts of it, her delight alſo being alſo with the Sons of Men: As one brought up with the</hi> Creator, <hi>his duily delight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing always before him.</hi>

Yes, Win his Affections to thy ſelf, and be eternally united to him.</p>
                  <p>Then ſhe uſeth all means to compaſs her ends: Firſt ſhe endeavours to draw him by her looks: And to <hi>raviſh his Heart with her Eyes</hi> (as with one of her Aſpects:) <hi>And with one Chain of her Neck,</hi> which her Virgin-Mother gave her.</p>

                  <p>For the Soul hankers after other Lovers, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling (as the Proverb ſaith, Holds with Hounds and runs with the Hare.) And thus hunting after other Lovers is never ſatisfied, but Conceits there is more Pleaſure hidden in other pretended Virgins

                  <p>I ſay the Soul often nouriſheth fooliſh Fancies in it ſelf, and becauſe he finds the Virgin or Pleaſant Vertue too eaſie to be attained, (according to the falſe Epicure:
<q>
                        <l>— Meus eſt amor huic ſimilis:</l>
                        <l>Nam Tranſvolat in medio poſita, &amp; fugentia captat:)</l>
                     </q> Therefore he aims at thoſe who ſeem more rare, and harder to be attained in his Judgment: Diſ-eſteems her Gifts and undervalues her Graces: But here his Judgment is blinded: For <hi>he ſeeth no form or come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> in the Virgin, nor any thing in her that might make her worthy to be deſired: And becomes gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually infected with falſe Love: He ſeeth and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon another pretended <hi>Delilah</hi> or Maid far more fair then God's Daughter; and endued (in his Opinion) with rarer and nober Qualities.</p>
                  <p>Thus the higher the Souls attainments and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of the pure Virgin hath been, the more baſely he becomes degenerated; For <hi>as dead Flyes cauſe, the</hi> moſt precious <hi>Ointment of the Apothecary to caſt forth a moſt nauſeous ſmell: So doth a little Folly him that</hi> was in a high Degree <hi>of Reputation for Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and honourable Enjoyment of God's Virgin-Child.</p>

                  <p>O (ſaith the Soul, having found the deceit of this Strumpets embraces,) now I enjoy the Sweet-heart of my fading Youth, which to fetch I endangered my precious Life, by paſſing through a fierce Fire of infernal Adultery: The Fire of my Paſſion is not ſo fierce as it was: When I was further from my deſired Fire, I burned (me thought) with <hi>Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rha</hi> more violently by a ſecret Conceit: Therefore now my Mind is variable, and wanders after freſh Lovers: I thirſt as the unſatisfied Womb, which receiveth without Conception.</p>

                  <p>But many a Soul in the midſt of theſe enjoyments, is often ſtruck with a Panick fear, and knows not whence it comes: For the Virgin who cauſeth it, is become a Stranger to her Fleſh and Blood: O (ſaith he) I have conquered in Triumph over one World, now I Luſt after another <hi>

Thus in particular, Fair Vertue (which is pure Pleaſure of the Soul) gives to the Soul that accepts of her, according to the capacity of the Receiver: 1. Treaſures of Eternal Life. 2.

But there is my Eternal Hell: Becauſe I croſſed the Mind of my Creator, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed her to be mine: But I appointed her Enemy for my everlaſting Companion, who will not lead a loving Life with me, but torment me with the Snake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Scourges of her Scorpion Furies. Now obſerve, here is the croſſing of the Eternal Fancy of the Soul, (if thou call it a Phantaſie) the Spirit of the Soul muſt have his Will, his deſired Object, the Virgin; Or he will die, and that Eternally. And the falſe Mind will enjoy <hi>Jezabel,</hi> the Object of his Love, or he will alſo dye the Eternal Death.
